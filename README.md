# Dynamic UI Elements

## A small collection of pre-made functions to make your DOM elements more dynamic

### turnIntoDropdown(menuContainerElement)

In your HTML, create a structure like this:

```
<div class="dropdown">
    <div>Menu</div>
    <div>Entr√©es</div>
    <div>Sides</div>
    <div>Drinks</div>
    <div>Desserts</div>
</div>
```

Then pass it into the function and it will transform into a dynamic dropdown menu.

The following arguments can, in this order, be passed:

| Argument (= default)         | Description                                                                                   |

| transitionTime (= "0.2s")    | Customize the transition time                                                                 |
